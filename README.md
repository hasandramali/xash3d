# Xash3D FWGS Engine (Fork) [![Windows Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/hasandramali/xash3d?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/hasandramali/xash3d)

Original project: [Xash3D Engine on ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/engines/xash3d-engine)  
Original codebase we're based on: [Xash3d FWGS (Old) on GitHub](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d)

Xash3D Engine is a custom game engine rewritten from scratch.  
Xash3D is compatible with many of the GoldSource games and mods  
and should be able to run most of existing singleplayer Half-Life mods without a hitch.  
The multiplayer is working, but network protocol isn't compatiable with the GoldSource Engine  
multiplayer mods should work just fine, but keep in mind that some features may not work at all  
or work not exactly the way they do in the GoldSource Engine.  

Xash3D-NG is a fork of Xash3D FWGS Engine (Old one) which itself is based on Xash3D by Uncle Mike, this fork aims on improving and bugfixing the original FWGS codebase.
